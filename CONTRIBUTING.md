# Contributing

## Contributing to Code
Before contributing, please read through the [Klarna Mobile SDK documentation](https://docs.klarna.com/mobile-sdk/).

### Branching
Prefix the branch you are going to work on depending on what you are working on (bug fix or feature). Use the following prefixes when creating a new branch:

* **feature/** if the branch contains a new feature, for example: `feature/my-shiny-feature`.
* **bugfix/**  if the branch contains a bug fix, for example: `bugfix/my-bug-fix`.

### Pull Requests
When creating a PR, please include as much information as possible about the type of enhancement, whether if it's a bugfix, new functionality, or any other change. There's [a template](https://github.com/klarna/klarna-mobile-sdk/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pull-request.md) for you to fill out, which will make the review process for the maintainers faster. When creating a PR do it against the `master` branch. The PR should include:

* **A clear and descriptive title**.
* **Description of the issue** if you are fixing a bug together with a link to the relevant issue or **background for introducing a new feature**.
